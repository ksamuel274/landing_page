                <p>Raised in Brooklyn, NY, my life has been profoundly shaped by the close-knit community that surrounded me. Since my youth, I've harbored a keen interest in engaging with local activities and nurturing a passion for understanding technology. I vividly recall disassembling my family's old Compaq computer in a quest to unravel its inner workings. Despite my parents' disapproval, little did they know that this seemingly rebellious act would lay the foundation for my future career.</p>
                <p>My educational journey has equipped me with a diverse set of skills, many of which I've shared along the way. During middle school, I actively participated in my school's robotics club, competing in NYC FIRST, an early program that ignited a collective passion for technology. This experience significantly influenced my decision to persistently pursue the path of technology throughout high school.</p>
                <p>In high school, I became a member of the non-profit organization Publicolor, dedicating my time to painting schools, shelters, and retirement homes with vibrant colors to enhance mood and engagement. The impact of this work extended beyond the visual transformation; it allowed me to forge unforgettable memories and lasting friendships while contributing to communities across NYC. As a testament to my efforts, I received recognition at my graduation for my contributions to the school community and the broader city."</p>
                <p>While in college, I embarked on a journey to attain my undergraduate degree in computer science, delving into the intricacies of computer programming. My coursework encompassed a diverse range of subjects, including algorithms, database systems, operating systems, data structures, and more. As I advanced through my undergraduate studies, I unearthed the vastness of the computer science realm and found joy in the continual exploration of new concepts and ideas.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am a master's student, dedicated to broadening my expertise and earning a degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. Despite the challenges of balancing a full-time job with my academic pursuits, I make a conscious effort to contribute to my community while advancing my education. My current objective is to build a career in cybersecurity, with the hope of inspiring others to follow a similar path</p>
