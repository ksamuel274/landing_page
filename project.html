            I have developed "The Craving App" a recipe application that I conceptualized and created. The primary objective of this app is to curate recipes directly from the web and provide users with a diverse array of meals from various regions and cultures. During my undergraduate studies, I passionately undertook this project as a personal endeavor. Although it was never officially released on the app store, I am pleased to inform you that the app is fully functional and operational to this day. Utilizing SwiftUI, I successfully crafted my inaugural application, a noteworthy accomplishment of which I am particularly proud. Enclosed within this correspondence, you will find the comprehensive source code and accompanying images showcasing the app's appearance. If you possess an Apple device and Xcode, I warmly welcome you to run the app at your convenience and kindly offer your valuable feedback and impressions.</p>

        <h2><a href="Files/Incident handler's journal .pdf">Detection and Response</a></h2>
        <p class="project-body">My understanding the NIST lifecycle, which offers a comprehensive framework for successfully handling security incidents, is essential to being competent in detection and response. It starts with planning, where proactive measures are created, including risk assessments and security controls. In the subsequent phase, detection, tools like tcpdump enable packet inspection to spot potential threats and irregularities in network traffic. A well-prepared security team can rely on a playbook to respond quickly and efficiently if a threat is identified, following predefined actions to mitigate the incident. Finally, post-incident analysis and learning are greatly aided by my usage of SIEM technologies like Splunk and Chronicle. With the use of these tools, you can conduct searches and investigations, learning important details about the incident and improving the ability to respond to similar situations in the future. With a powerful foundation in these areas, I can significantly contribute to the detection and response efforts in an organization's cybersecurity posture.</p>
