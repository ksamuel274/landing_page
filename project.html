        <h2>Statement</h2>
        <p class="statement">In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, the significance of cyber security has reached unprecedented heights. Recognizing this, I am deeply impassioned by the field of cybersecurity and find immense satisfaction in developing solutions that not only safeguard organizations but also positively impact the individuals they serve.
            As I embark on my journey into the realm of cybersecurity, my aspiration is to establish a reputation for innovation and proactive contributions to fortify processes aimed at protecting an organization's invaluable assets. As a cyber security analyst, my primary objective would be to ensure the utmost data security through the proficient use of cutting-edge SIEM tools like Splunk. By leveraging my expertise in SQL, I would also guarantee the availability and integrity of critical information stored within databases. Moreover, I am committed to upholding the highest standards of confidentiality to safeguard personal information from unauthorized access.
            <br><br>
            Beyond technical prowess, I recognize the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats, and I am dedicated to continuously expanding my knowledge and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the field. By cultivating a proactive mindset, I aim to preemptively identify vulnerabilities and respond effectively to emerging threats, thereby reinforcing the resilience of the organizations I serve.
            Driven by an unwavering commitment to excellence and a genuine passion for cyber security, I am eager to contribute my skills and expertise to the dynamic and challenging landscape of the cybersecurity industry. By joining forces with like-minded professionals, I aspire to create a safer digital environment for businesses, individuals, and society as a whole.

            I have developed "The Craving App" a recipe application that I conceptualized and created. The primary objective of this app is to curate recipes directly from the web and provide users with a diverse array of meals from various regions and cultures. During my undergraduate studies, I passionately undertook this project as a personal endeavor. Although it was never officially released on the app store, I am pleased to inform you that the app is fully functional and operational to this day. Utilizing SwiftUI, I successfully crafted my inaugural application, a noteworthy accomplishment of which I am particularly proud. Enclosed within this correspondence, you will find the comprehensive source code and accompanying images showcasing the app's appearance. If you possess an Apple device and Xcode, I warmly welcome you to run the app at your convenience and kindly offer your valuable feedback and impressions.</p>
